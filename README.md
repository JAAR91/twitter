## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

- First, you need to fork the repository [Twitter](https://github.com/JAAR91/twitter)

- Copy the ssh using the green code button

- Then you clone the repository to your pc using, the command on your terminal:

```
git clone 'ssh code  you copy early'
```

### Setup

Install gems with:

```
bundle install
```

Then use the following code on your terminal:

```
run yarn install
```

then

```
rails webpack:install
```

Setup database with:

```
   rails db:create
   rails db:migrate
```

If you get and error while creating the database then you have to install Postgres, follow the steps [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-postgresql-on-ubuntu-20-04-quickstart), once installed you only need to create a user and the database.

To create the database type on your terminal:
```
sudo -u postgres psql
```
Then type:
```
createdb twitterdb
```
Now you cant try to create the database again.

To make easier the creation of the database, use to create the database and create the tables at the same time:
```
bash createdb.sh
```

### Usage

Start server with:

```
    rails server
```

Open `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.


### Test

To run test you need to create the test database with Postgres, first get into Postgres configuration using:
```
sudo -i -u Postgres
```
Then create the database using:
```
createdb twitterdbtest
```
To exit just type:
```
exit
```
To test the functions of the project just run:

```
    rspec
```

If you want to add more test just go to rspec/features folder, create a new file for each one of the tables.
